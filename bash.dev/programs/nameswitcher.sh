# * Switches resolving nameservers in case of trouble
# *
# * You can define multiple nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf, but in reality
# * this works like crap because the timeout before your system switches to a
# * secondary nameserver is way to long for any serious networked application.
# *
# * So not reaching that 1 nameserver can potentially result in gigantic loads
# * and server outage.
# *
# * To prevent, you could schedule this script which will periodically check
# * nameserver health, and switch to Google's nameserver in case of trouble.
# * Also switches back when trouble is over.
# *
# * Tested as cronjob on Ubuntu servers
# *
# * Change the PRIMARY config variable to your own resolving nameserver
